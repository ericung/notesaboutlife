These are all wild

Badgers\
Gophers\
Hawks\
Wolf - Travels in packs and keeps the rest of the animals in control\
Raven\
Bear - Mommy’s boys\

Owl\
Fox\

What happens when we spoil a bird? Are they birds of paradise or birds of prey?\

Food Wars

Muffins - Light as air and sweet\
Chicken Noodle Soup - For the sick\
Potatoes - Healthy and hearty\
Dasani - Essential but need to cleanse and purify it otherwise you’ll get salmonella\
Beer - It’s usually brown, stays at home, and used for fun\

Sometimes food needs to be produced in a factory but it’s artificial and has too many preservatives but if they are produced with time, skills, and love at home they have soul.

Indian Caste ~ Social Class in the UK

These models doesn’t allow much room for social mobility

Warriors, Kings ⇔ Priests, Academics
Merchants, Landowners
Commoners, Peasants, Servants

Peasant kings like Ghandi rise out of this

King Arthur and the knights of the round table searching for the fountain of youth but life is too short

===============================================================

Fool => Wise Man => Are Mad King and Wise King the same?

Laughing is the best medicine\
Sleeping heals wounds

===============================================================

All about women

1. Girls take after their dads

Some guys trash girls, some make them more beautiful, others in between

Some guys need girls the same age, others don’t

Guys embody three things {Body, Mind, Spirit} and the girls follow that unless the roles are reversed\
Body => Beauty\
Mind => Brains\
Spirit => Personality\

Kings in a chess board don’t move much and so the princess is protected in the castle

Your brothers and sisters will always be at home with mom

Decline of marriage and increase of divorces comes from not understanding the first law

===============================================================

Making money

Body - Presence is the bare minimum
Skills - Develop basic skills
Skills with Passions - Develop desired skills with passion
Ideas - Learn how to make new ideas and build off of other ideas
