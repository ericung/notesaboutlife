# Animals in the United States

These are all wild

Badgers\
Gophers\
Hawks\
Wolf - Travels in packs and keeps the rest of the animals in control\
Raven\
Bear - Mommy’s boys\
Eagles - These protect freedom of speech. Everything you see on the internet is based off a language. This is why America will always be leaders. This is definitely not an excuse to why porn and strip clubs are allowed.\
Hawks\
Deer\

Hares\
Woodpecker\
Owl\
Fox

What happens when we spoil a bird? Are they birds of paradise or birds of prey?\

# Food Wars

Muffins as light as air and sweet\
Chicken Noodle Soup are for the sick\
Potatoes are healthy and hearty\
Dasani are essential but need to cleanse and purify it otherwise you’ll get salmonella\
Beer are usually brown, stays at home, and used for fun

Sometimes food needs to be produced in a factory but it’s artificial and has too many preservatives but if they are produced with time, skills, and love at home they have soul.

# Indian Caste ~ Social Class in the UK

These models doesn’t allow much room for social mobility

Warriors, Kings ⇔ Priests, Academics
Merchants, Landowners
Commoners, Peasants, Servants

Peasant kings like Ghandi rise out of this

King Arthur and the knights of the round table searching for the fountain of youth but life is too short

# The Old Treatment

Overthink a little too much?

Fool => Wise Man => Are Mad King and Wise King the same?

Three Natural Medicines\
Laughing is the best medicine\
Time heals all wounds\
Sleeping more than usual

Sorry it took so long to come back home babe

Find a craft\
Writing, Listening and making art\
Networking, Interviewing, and Acting\
Pursuit and extension of human knowledge and ideas

Eating a lot of fat for a little while helps.\
Exercising too.

What happens if you make a fool out of a king?

:thumbsdown:

# All about women

1. Girls take after their dads through their jeans and their genes

Some guys trash girls, some make them more beautiful, others in between

Some guys need girls the same age, others don’t

Guys embody three things {Body, Mind, Spirit} and the girls follow that unless the roles are reversed\
Body => Beauty\
Mind => Brains\
Spirit => Personality

Kings in a chess board don’t move much and so the princess is protected in the castle

Your brothers and sisters will always be at home with mom

Decline of marriage and increase of divorces comes from not understanding the first law

# Making money if you don't want to be a porn star

Body - Presence is the bare minimum otherwise you're just cannon fodder. Just for looks\
Skills - Develop basic skills that isn't that fun\
Skills with Passions - Develop desired skills with passion\
Ideas - Figure out how to learn how to make new ideas, if you didn't develop skills that you were passionate about, you'll just end up being unoriginal

# Knocking out a feminazi with romance

Don't want to look like a gay fag practicing with another dude?\
Footwork for salsa and swing <=> Footwork for taekwondo and boxing\
Smooth talking your way as a cashier at the local grocery store\
Buying roses to knockout the feminazis\
Get Emma Watson'ed you thirty communists, you're in the wrong country

-----

# Triple X

Triple X is for the sex that makes the world move.\
Boys go to war and the ones that come out turn into men.\
The games we play as children lead ageless lives\
And as light sways away towards lies again,\
My rage subsides so that I can finally rest by your side.

*It's called the boy's club for a reason*\
*You can still be a little boy when you're 50*

-----

# Flowers

There towers the most magnificent flower.\
Stacked one by one towards the sky.\
It's green on the ground and blue up high.\
Brown when it rots, replaced when it's old\
Or brown mothers earth, gives and grows.\
There's one for one, two for two\
and this one is just for you.

There exists a girl that is equal to you and not equal to you.\
Equal to you in that she is your type,\
Not equal to you in that she is younger than you.
*Harder path.*

There exists a girl that is equal to you and not equal to you.\
Equal to you in age,\
Not equal to you in mind for females mature earlier.
*The probability of getting dumped increases, just a warning.*

Rule 69\
Initially,\
Girls like older guys for their money, status, and power,\
Guys like younger girls for their body.\
Initially,\
Girls like guys for the upper four holes,\
Guys like girls for their lower four holes.


Rule 88\
Guys must work on their bodies to fill the lower four holes.\
Then they must work on their eyes and ears to be in a long lasting relationship.\
It follows that girls must work on their bodies to fill the first four holes.\
Then they must work on their upper holes to have a long lasting relationship.

69 comes before 88

Do not worry if you see no girls in sight\
for if you are bold in pursuing your dreams,\
a queen will deem you worthy of a wife fitting of you.

*It gives people watching over you time to find the right type of girl*

-----

**Pursuing truth gives freedom by lessening responsibility from those in power and prevents wars.**
